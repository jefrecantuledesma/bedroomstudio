# Bedroom Studio by Peter Semiletov
A set of LV2 plugins for bedroom music studios :) The goal is to provide simple, nice-sounding effects for those who want to become a musical legend.

Current plugin list:

**Metalluga** - the hard and crisp distortion with five controls to customize the effect for your needs: *Drive*, *Level*, *Weight*, *Resonance*, and *Warmth*. The main control is *Level*, and all the other parameters build around it. If you don't mess too much with the distortion levels, you can use Metalluga for softer genres, such as blues.

**Bronza** -  the plain fuzz pedal with two parameters - *Level* and *Fuzz*. It sounds like a pedal from the sixties!

**Grelka Overdrive** - the classic overdrive, with parameters for *Drive*, *Level*, *Lows*, and *Treble* to shape the sound.

**Charm** - the saturation effect which makes sounds more "analog."
